HOWTO BUILD POPPLER 0.22.2 FROM SOURCES USING MinGW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside archive you can find following directory structure:
  src - for poppler sources
  deps - for unpacked build dependencies
  arch - for downloaded archives 
    (build-time and run-time dependencies aka dev and bin packages)
  deps_runtime - for unpacked runtime dependencies

1. Assuming that you already have development environment installed:
  - MingW (I used zip archive from http://get.qt.nokia.com/misc/MinGW-gcc440_1.zip)
  - Qt libraries (I used 4.7.3, http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.7.3-mingw.exe)
    intalled into c:\qt\4.7.3-mingw
  - MSYS (needed for building lcms)
  - utils such wget, patch, diff, etc.  Must be in folder that in PATH variable.
  - CMake (http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.6-win32-x86.exe)

2. Unpack archive into some directory. My was c:\dev\poppler_build

3. Build script should download, unpack, patch and build all dependencies.

4. Edit build.bat to set variables:
   - TOP - directory where you unpacked archive including msvc or mingw subdirs
   - QT_BIN - directory where Qt binaries installed

5. Run build.bat and wait some time until script finished.
  
6. After successfull build, files will be places into %TOP%\build directory
   
7. Runtime dependencies should be copied automatically by into %TOP%\build\bin by build script.

That's all
