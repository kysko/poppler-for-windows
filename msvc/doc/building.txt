HOWTO BUILD POPPLER 0.22.0 FROM SOURCES USING MS VISUAL STUDIO 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside archive you can find following directory structure:
  src - for poppler sources
  deps - for unpacked build dependencies
  arch - for downloaded archives 
    (build-time and run-time dependencies aka dev and bin packages)
  deps_runtime - for unpacked runtime dependencies
  docs - notes and instructions

1. Assuming that you already have development environment installed:
  - Visual Studio 2008 (Express or Professional, I used professional) 
  - CMake (http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.6-win32-x86.exe)
  - Qt libraries (optional, I used 4.7.3, http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.7.3-vs2008.exe)
    intalled into c:\qt\4.7.3-msvc2008
  - utils such wget, patch, diff, etc (included in archive). Must be in PATH variable (build script handles this).

2. Unpack archive into some directory. My was c:\dev\poppler_build. 
  NOTE: I didn't tested build if path contains spaces, so it's better to not have spaces in path.

3. Go to msvc directory.
  There are already downloaded, unpacked and patched poppler sources and dependencies,
  But script should download, unpack and patch them in case if they don't exist.
  (You can also re-download, unpack and patch it with get_poppler.bat and get_deps.bat scripts)
  !WARNING! 
  I encountered with access violation in pdf2cairo.exe launched  with -png or -jpeg.
  I found one solution is to build libpng statically.
  I don't know, maybe there's better solution but it works.
  Script should build static version automatically and place it as deps\libpng\libpng_static.lib
  Sources for static version is in libpng directory
  Also, you still need libpng14-14.dll in PATH because libcairo-2.dll need it in runtime.

4. Optional. edit build.bat to set destination directory (where product files will be placed),
   variable INSTALL_PREFIX
   Now it is C:\temp\poppler-msvc2008

5. Run build.bat and wait some time
  (it needed about 5-7 min in my configuration - Intel P8400 CPU)
  
6. After successfull build, files will be places into C:\temp\poppler-msvc2008
   (or another, if you changed it).

7. Place runtime dependencies (from deps_runtime directory) into directory which accessible througt PATH
   environment variable or directly inside poppler output directory  (C:\temp\poppler-msvc2008)
   Also you can use get_runtime_deps.bat to donwload all runtime dependencies.

That's all
